1. Rework html frontend
    a. Maybe add a loading bar for the processing part
2. Implement better color heuristic
    b. Can use a set of dominant colors rather than 1 dominant color. 
        The palette should already give this set. Just need to implement the logic
3. Clean up code and make it production ready
